            <h2>About the principle <br> Psychologist & Hypnotherapist</h2>
            <h3>Samantha Tay</h3>
            <p>Hypnotherapy may help treat any number of medical conditions in which psychological factors influence physical symptoms.

                Common mental health uses include:
                
                Stress and anxiety, especially before medical or dental procedures; panic attacks; and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD).
                Hypnosis isn’t sleeping. There are some deeper forms of hypnosis that could make you appear to be asleep because your body is very still and quiet, but you aren’t asleep.</p>
